                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Title Tag:</b> Title tag is one of the most important things to do to make your website search engine optimised. Search engines use a title tag to know what a page entails 
                            and that the keyword the user is searching is relevant to your webpage.You must not duplicate tutle tags and keep title tags less than 55 characters long.(“SEO Best Practices—On-Page SEO Checklist | Orbit Media,” 2014)
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Break Up The Content with Header Tags: </b> Using the H1 tag in your webpage helps google search engine algorithm link it up with the word(s) the client is searching which will improve your ranking and drive traffic to your website.
                            In your H1 tag only use your keyword once. Use H2 tag to separate content within your webpage.(“SEO Best Practices—On-Page SEO Checklist | Orbit Media,” 2014)
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Keywords Research: </b> Google has a keyword tool that you can use , enter the main keywords your want to target and google will give you suggestions based on what users are searching on Google.(Tarcomnicu, 2015)</li>
                        <li><b>Update Content Regularly: </b> You need to update your website regularly(2 to 3 times a week) Google sees this a well updated website. The reason you should update your website is
                             because everytime you update your website googles crawlers detect a change and scan through your website again and it could potentially increase your SEO ranking. Users also visit websites that have newer and "fresher" information which will also increase and maintain traffic to your website.(“5 Reasons Why Fresh Content is Critical for Your Website and SEO,” n.d.)
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Add Metadata to the Website: </b> while it does not directly affect your SEO ranking but it is extremely important to get user to click on your website from the results page because the keywords will be highlighted that the user has searched for.
                             Avoid making duplicated metadata and do not add quotes or non-alpha numbers because google will cut them out.(“SEO Best Practices—On-Page SEO Checklist | Orbit Media,” 2014)
                            </li>
                        <li><b>Fix Broken Links on your website: </b> links that you have put on your website that do not work will have a negative effect on your SEO ranking. You need to make sure all of your links are working correctly.(“50 Best Practices for SEO That Will Ignite Growth,” 2018)</li>
                        <li><b>Use Alt Tags: </b>Use alt text on images to help describe what your image is, yes googles AI can detect what is in a image but it does not know the full scope of a image which googles crawlers will use the alt tag to help understand what is in your image which increases your SEO because if a user
                            is searching for a specific image google will bring up your website a lot more often than other websites that are not using alt tags (increasing SEO ranking). Another benifit to using alt tags is making your website more accessable for people who are impaired and cannot see the images which will increase traffic to your website.(Alt Text for Images: 2019 SEO Best Practices)
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Content Has Target Keywords and Phrases: </b> The content is the main part of the website and as some sources say "the meat and potatoes". You need to make your
                            content unique , if you have content that is the same on multiple pages and that you have other websites content on your page Google will penalize you and drop your search ranking. 
                            Make content Relative to the keyword, use keywords 4 times in your content and use links within your website that point at your content.(“SEO Best Practices—On-Page SEO Checklist | Orbit Media,” 2014) 
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Have a Sitemap: </b> Having a sitemap included in your website is very important for making your site search engine optimized. It helps google crawel your website to make it rank higher.(Tarcomnicu, 2015)</li>
                        <li><b>Cloaking: </b> You need to show the same information to google crawlers that your users would see (you can not hid text that a user of your website can not see) if google detects that you are "cloaking" they will take action and decrease your SEO ranking.(“On-Page SEO | The Beginner’s Guide to SEO,” n.d.)</li>
